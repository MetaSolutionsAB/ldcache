# LD Cache

LD Cache is a minimum footprint caching server for Linked (Open) Data.

Initial development was carried out within a [VINNOVA-funded project](http://metasolutions.se/projects/vidareutveckling-av-lankade-oppna-data-for-nobelpris/) for opening up information about Nobel Prizes and Nobel Laureates as Linked Open Data.
